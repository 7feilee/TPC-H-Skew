# tpch_skew_linux

TPC-H with skew factor (Zipf distribution) enabled. Use `dbgen` with `-z` option to input the skew when generating benchmark data. There are several makefile available for different OSs and settings. Try them if the default makefile doesn't work.

This is the linux version on github. I forked from somewhere on github which I forget now ...
